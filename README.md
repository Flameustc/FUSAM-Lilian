# BC Addon Manager

**NOTE**: not ready

## Users

This provides you with a single interface to manage all your addons.

## Developers

For addon developers this means you do not have to include the modding SDK or have your own instructions for users to install your addon; simply point them here.

To get your addon added, please contact Sidsel via [BC Scripting Community Discord](https://discord.gg/SHJMjEh9VH) or create a merge request for manifest.json. The following information is required:
- short name / ID, alphanumeric
- long name
- short description
- author name
- link to the script
